## Rust Programs

### MintLab Program Library - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/mintlab)
A collection of all the Solana programs that MintLab actively maintains. Each program is published to [https://mintlab.alishop.my.id/].

## SDKs

These high-level SDKs make it easy to interact with our programs.

### JavaScript SDK - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/mintlab-js) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlab-js)
Our JS SDK is a high-level SDK for interacting with our programs and is built on top of our autogenerated libraries. It is currently in active development.

### iOS SDK - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/mintlab-ios)
Our new iOS SDK is built from scratch in Swift to provide a smooth experience for interacting with NFTs. It uses a similar interface to our JS SDK.

### Android SDK - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/mintlab-android)
Our Android SDK was implemented from scratch in native Kotlin and is being developed in parallel with our iOS SDK. Like the iOS SDK, it also features a similar interface to our JS SDK.

## Autogenerated Libraries

The following libraries were autogenerated by Solita. A link to each Rust crate on Crates.io is also provided for convenience.

### MPL Token Metadata - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/mpl-token-metadata) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mpl-token-metadata)
The MPL Token Metadata program allows SPL tokens to add metadata and is one of the most important programs when dealing with NFTs on the Solana blockchain.

### MPL Auction House - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/mpl-auction-house) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mpl-auction-house) / Metaboss
The MPL Auction House program is a protocol for marketplaces to implement a decentralized sales contract. It allows for escrowless sales where the NFT doesn’t leave the seller’s wallet until the sale is complete.

### MPL Candy Machine - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/mpl-candy-machine) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mpl-candy-machine)
The MPL Candy Machine program enables creators to easily and safely launch NFT collections without worrying about the rent overhead from minting NFTs themselves.

## Tools

### Sugar, the Candy Machine CLI - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/sugar)
Sugar is our new Candy Machine CLI, built in Rust. It is incredibly fast and easy to use.

### Shank - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/shank)
Shank is a tool that generates IDLs from native Solana programs.

### Solita - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/solita)
Solita (SOLana Idl To Api) converts IDLs generated by Shank into JavaScript SDKs.

### Amman - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/amman)
Amman, along with the Amman Explorer, is a set of testing tools that make it easy to test Solana programs locally and see deserialized states change in real-time on the explorer.

## UIs

### Candy Machine UI - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/candy-machine-ui)
A reference minting UI for Candy Machine projects.

### Showcase - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/showcase)
The Showcase UI allows users to display all their purchased NFTs in a public profile.

### Token Entangler UI - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/token-entangler-ui)
The Token Entangler UI aims to help de-rug projects.

## Deprecated

The following repositories are no longer maintained by MintLab.

### Storefront - [GitHub](https://github.com/Alishop99/storefront)
The deprecated MintLab Storefront frontend for self-hosted NFT marketplaces.
